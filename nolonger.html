  <h1>📘 Maha/Maheen's Digital Diary: Entries for the Loser 📘</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="date">April 2 — “ loser, it’s my birthday and now you’re part of my diary gang”</p>
    <p>Yo loser,<br>It’s me, Maheen. Welcome to my diary gang. You’ve now officially acquired a spot in my notes.  
    <br><br>Starting this on my birthday cause why not? I really enjoyed playing Roblox with you today btw, it actually made my day 10x better. i like playimg with you
    I always wanted to be a writer, yk poet? So throughout this friendship or whatever, you might see a bunch of random letters show up. That’s if we do end up being close… or maybe all this will be a waste, who knows lol.
    <br><br>Anyway, congratulations loser, you’re now part of my little project.
    I’m learning Python coding now, trying to make a digital diary and everything. I’m doing this for Natasha, Reina, DJ… and you.
    <br>Guess I’m close to y’all at the moment. So yeah. Congrats on being in the early gang.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="date">April 11 — “no title for this entry”</p>
    <p>YO GANGGG, it’s officially Entry 2. And guess what — I think this thing is working.  
    <br><br>If you’re reading this now, it probably means one of two things:
    <br>1. We stopped being friends  
    <br>2. I’m dead  
    <br><br>In that case, Natasha is supposed to send this to you. Hopefully it’s the second reason and not the first LOL 😂  
    <br><br>Even though it’s just been a few months of knowing you, I think you’re kinda cool… twin. (No, you’re still a loser).  
    Ik all things come to an end, but I honestly don’t see you ever getting tired of me.  
    <br>So I guess we’re in it for the long run, huh? But if not enjoy it while it lasts- thats what u said im happy im ur friend tho lol</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="date">May 1 — “this remind me of that anime… except I’m not dying Yet.”</p>
    <p>This reminds me of *I Want to Eat Your Pancreas*… except I’m not dying (yet).  
    <br>You’re just like the guy in that story  a great friend, even if we haven’t spent that much time together.  
    <br>You’re kinda like Natasha too. I can be myself around her. Like, I can be stupid, annoying, loud and she still takes me seriously when I’m sad.  
    <br>And I feel the same with you. i really cant be the same around sabrin tbh she will slap me for sure if i end up crying front of her😅 
    <br><br>I’ve told you a lot in just a few months. You’ve lowkey taught me things, made me better, even if you’re rude sometimes(IK THOSE ARE JOKES).  
    <br>Still, your actions speak louder than your goofy insults. You're my platonic friend like yk, if I say I'll miss you, I don’t mean it in a weird way. I mean it as a friend. And you're a dude, so yeahh   
    <br>You’re a kind soul or whatever, and I’m glad I know you, loser. Not everything lasts forever, but all you can do is hope it sticks around long enough and I hope being friends w u last long.and thanks for naming me also moon ill call u  hamzina btw my actul name is maha maheen too but maha is the name given by my grandparents</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="date">May 5 — “Wish u were a girl lol (but u a loser instead)”</p>
    <p>Lol I fell asleep writing that.  
    <br>Is this weird? Cuz you’re not a girl. I wish you were, it would make all this less weird 😭  
    <br>Anyway, if I die, Natasha knows what to do. She’s not even Muslim, but yeah… whatever.  
    <br>I give you the permission to swear on my name.  also why r u so zesty sometimes well most of the time i say out of pocket things and forget that u r a guy u r js gay appect it
    <br><br>Lol I haven’t had time to complete these entries. I’ve been doing Natasha’s, but I keep forgetting about yours  so yeah, it’s all over the place, not how I intended. But when summer starts, around your birthday, I’ll fix it up and make it better lol.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="date">May 10 — "hamzina"</p>
    <p>Hamzina — your friend Khalid is weird.  
    <br>Okay, so here’s what I thought of you when I first started talking to you.  
    <br>You were weird. like why r u liking everyones notes u  jobless hoe 
    <br>LIKE WHO CALLS SOMEONE A BASTARD A FEW DAYS INTO KNOWING THEM??  you also ragebait sabrin alot😭 poor girl hates u now its ok atleast dj n reina think u r ok or i hope so atleast they r still pissed abt what sravya said to vishnu its fine ill convince them u r nice i trust what u said so ya i hope u guys will be friends one day 
    <br>Anyway I have tuition byeee</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="date">May 13 — “You’re just easy to know.”</p>
    <p>Even though I haven’t known you as long as Reina or Natasha, there’s something about your vibe.  
    <br>It’s easy. Like a song you accidentally memorize.  
    <br>You make people comfortable. Not just me — even Reina (who usually takes time with people), she gets you.  
    <br>DJ, Sabrin — they’re not like that around just anyone.  
    <br><br>When you said you’re going back to the Philippines, I won’t lie — that's sad.  
    <br>Like what do you mean I’m losing an autistic monkey??  
    <br><br>But I guess that’s life.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="date">May 16 — “i don't get why ppl hate u.”</p>
    <p>I got fucked up by Tamogana but I already said u abt it. tdy is js shit n i already sent this letter to u
    <br>But yeah Hamza, I don’t get why people dislike you. When you told me people talk shit about you, I was actually confused.  
    <br>Like who could hate someone as autistic as you??  
    <br><br>I’m nice to everyone, usually. But with you  I’m only mean because I actually like you.  
    <br>And I expect people I care about to mind read my thoughts and just get it when I’m sad.  
    <br><br>“So whenever u see me being mean ya gang.”  
    <br>“Someone I can actually be sad around. Vulnerable, even. Which is crazy, because I hate being sad around people. The only ones I ever be sad around is Natasha. But… yeah.”  
    <br>“I just hope the version of you I know is real and not some mask you wear.. tbh I hope we stay friends for a long time.”  
    <br><br>Anyway, that’s enough niceness for one day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="date">June 10 — “We stopped talking and now you want a TikTok streak??”</p>
    <p>We stopped talking.  
    <br>But this b*tch wants to keep a TikTok streak.  
    <br>Pisses me off.  
    <br>Why are you like this.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="date">June 26 — “autistic returns (kinda)”</p>
    <p>We started talking again 😝 We’re autistic like that fr.  
    <br>I still hate you for calling me weird tho. But wtv.  
    <br>You’re starting to give me a weird vibe again.  
    <br>Like I can’t explain it, but it’s like I’m forcing you to be my friend.  
    <br>And I don’t wanna feel like that.  
    <br>But maybe it’s just my brain being extra like usual and im thinking alot 
    <br><br>Idk. Let’s see what happens.  
    <br>End of entry… for now.  
    <br>— Maheen</p>
